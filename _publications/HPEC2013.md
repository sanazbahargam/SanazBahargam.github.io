## Abstract
The increasing deployment of networked mobile
embedded devices leads to unique challenges communications
security. This is especially true for embedded biomedical devices
and robotic materials handling, in which subversion or denial of
service could result in loss of human life and other catastrophic
outcomes.
In this paper we present the Learning Intrusion Detection
System (L-IDS), a network security service for protecting embedded mobile devices within institutional boundaries, which can be
deployed alongside existing security systems with no modifications
to the embedded devices. L-IDS utilizes the OpenFlow SoftwareDefined Networking architecture, which allows it to both detect
and respond to attacks as they happen.
