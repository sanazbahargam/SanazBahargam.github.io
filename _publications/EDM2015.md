## Abstract
Whether teaching in a classroom or a Massive Online Open
Course it is crucial to present the material in a way that
benefits the audience as a whole. We identify two important
tasks to solve towards this objective; (1.) group students so
that they can maximally benefit from peer interaction and
(2.) find an optimal schedule of the educational material
for each group. Thus, in this paper, we solve the problem of
team formation and content scheduling for education. Given
a time frame d, a set of students S with their required need
to learn different activities T and given k as the number of
desired groups, we study the problem of finding k group of
students. The goal is to teach students within time frame d
such that their potential for learning is maximized and find
the best schedule for each group. We show this problem to
be NP-hard and develop a polynomial algorithm for it. We
show our algorithm to be effective both on synthetic as well
as a real data set. For our experiments, we use real data
on students’ grades in a Computer Science department. As
part of our contribution, we release a semi-synthetic dataset
that mimics the properties of the real data.
