## Abstract
Computer science researchers in the programming languages and formal verification
communities have produced a variety of automated tools and techniques for assisting formal
reasoning tasks. However, while there exist notable successes in utilizing these tools to
develop safe and secure software and hardware, both leading-edge advances and basic
techniques (such as model checking, state space search, type checking, logical inference
and verification, computation of congruence closures, non-interference enforcement, and
so on) remain underutilized by large populations of end-users that may benefit from them
when they engage in formal reasoning tasks within their own application domains. This
may be in part because (1) these tools and techniques are not readily accessible to endusers who are not experts in formal systems or are simply not aware of what is available
and how it can be utilized, and (2) these tools and techniques are only valuable when
used in conjunction with one another and with appropriate domain-specific libraries and
databases.
Motivated by these circumstances, we present our ongoing efforts, built on earlier work
in developing user-friendly formal verification tools, to develop a platform for assembling,
instantiating, and deploying user-friendly, interactive, integrated formal reasoning environments that can assist users engaged in routine domain-specific formal reasoning tasks in
application domains. This infrastructure encompasses a programming language, compilers,
and other tools for building up from components, instantiating with domain-specific formal
content, and finally delivering such environments in the form of ready-to-use web-based
applications that can run entirely within a standard web browser. We describe current efforts to use this platform to instantiate an environment the application domain of correct
network protocol design.
