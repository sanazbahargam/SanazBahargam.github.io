## Abstract
The growing popularity of data-driven decision making, coupled with the increased availability of
affordable infrastructure for storing large volumes of information, have established data as a firm’s most
valuable asset. To take advantage and monetize from this asset, a firm needs talented employees with the
skills required to analyze large data repositories, identify opportunities to improve the various aspects of a
firm’s operations, and inform strategies that can be used to fully take advantage of such opportunities.
While such individuals have always existed and held various titles within firms, the era of Big Data and
Analytics has brought them together to create a new cast of “data scientists”. Famously dubbed as “the
sexiest job of the 21st century” , this new role has become a hiring priority for firms across industries. In
1
addition, the ever-increasing demand and highly competitive salaries have established data science
positions as highly desirable targets for fresh graduates and experienced workers who feel that they have
the skills required to transition to data scientist roles. For all interested parties, the key question is the
same: what is it that makes a good data scientist?
