My name is Sanaz Bahargam. I completed a Ph.D. degree at the [Computer Science](http://www.cs.bu.edu/) Department of [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/) in June 2017. 
<!---  and I am currently at Twitter, working on NLP and Learning to Rank problems. -->
My research interests are in the areas of Natural Language Processing, Applied Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Algorithmic Data Mining.
During my Ph.D., I worked with Professor [Evimaria Terzi](https://www.cs.bu.edu/~evimaria/), Professor [Theodoros Lappas](http://tedlappas.com/), and Professor  [Vagelis Papalexakis](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~epapalex/). Before joining [Data Mining and Machine Learning Group](http://www.bu.edu/cs/dblab/) in 2015, I was a member of [Networks Research Group](http://www.bu.edu/cs/nrg/) and [iBench Initiative](https://sites.google.com/site/ibenchbu/) working with Professor [Azer Bestavros](http://azer.bestavros.net/).

Besides work, I often play volley with friends, I enjoy [hiking](https://photos.app.goo.gl/qB9zyZesNQTKm1GXA) and [photography](https://photos.app.goo.gl/GSWXzNiYngkzVQTu7). 

My Erdős number is 1. I have a [publication](https://sanazbahargam.github.io/publication/EDM2015) with Erdős (not Paul, but with Dóra who happens to be a mathematician before entering the computer science field) :) For real my [Paul] Erdős number is 4.
