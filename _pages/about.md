I completed a Ph.D. degree at [Computer Science](http://www.cs.bu.edu/) Department of [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/) in June 2017 and I am currently a machine learning engineer working on NLP and Learning to Rank problems.  My research interests are in the areas of Natural Language Processing, applied machine learning and deep learning, algorithmic data-mining.
During my Ph.D., I worked with Professor [Evimaria Terzi](https://www.cs.bu.edu/~evimaria/), Professor [Theodoros Lappas](http://tedlappas.com/), and Professor  [Vagelis Papalexakis](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~epapalex/). Before joining [Data Mining and Machine Learning Group](http://www.bu.edu/cs/dblab/) in 2015, I was a member of [Networks Research Group](http://www.bu.edu/cs/nrg/) and [iBench Initiative](https://sites.google.com/site/ibenchbu/) working with Professor [Azer Bestavros](http://azer.bestavros.net/).
