In this post, I briefly explain what is conditional random Fields and how they can be used for sequence labeling.
CRF is a discriminative model best suited for tasks in which contextual information or state of the neighbors affects the current prediction. CRFs are widely used in named entity recognition, part of speech tagging, gene prediction, noise reduction, and object detection problems. 

In order to understand this post, it’s helpful to first read about Hidden Markov Models and Gibbs Distribution. 
This video explains the basics of [HMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqSzLo9fenk&ab_channel=LuisSerrano) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzlYOX0wrz0&ab_channel=MachineLearningTV) by Daphne Koller is a very good introduction on Gibbs distribution.

Now let’ see why we need CRF?
