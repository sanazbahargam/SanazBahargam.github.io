My [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HDDgSVEJgAom4cdgxtrPdFmMkMYXckqi) on Masked Language Modeling (MLM) + Fine Tuning for Text Classification with BERT. In this notebook, you can see how to train a BERT model on your data for MLM task and then fine tune it for text classification. This includes how to encode the data, masked the tokens (similar to [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)) and train a model from scratch (or train on a pretrained model :). You can load this model and fine tuned it on your labeled data for classification.
